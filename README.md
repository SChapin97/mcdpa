# MCDPA (Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act)


## Purpose
- To log work done to find out who owns my data, who they sell it to, and other related details that I can use the MCDPA to gather.


### Repro steps:
1. Use [google takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) to download just google mail data
2. Develop a tool to find every email address that has ever sent me an email (that I can tell)
3. Use obsidian or some other data visualization tool to add a file/node so I can map out who has what data and who they give this data to.
